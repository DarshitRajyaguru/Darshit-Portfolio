            I developed custom WordPress plugins and integrated WooCommerce for

            iDalko is a leading provider of enterprise-grade integration
            solutions for Jira. I was responsible for redeveloping and enhancing
            their WordPress site to better reflect their technical authority and
            support their B2B lead generation strategy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site was built using Elementor Pro along with custom WordPress
            templates and add-ons. I implemented flexible and reusable content
            blocks using Custom Post Types, integrated WooCommerce to manage
            services and downloadable assets, and ensured seamless
            responsiveness across all devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            A major enhancement included the creation of a fully responsive mega

          <p>Standby24 UK is a professional healthcare staffing agency providing
            job opportunities and workforce solutions across the UK. This
            website was fully designed and developed from scratch, following a
            performance-first approach and business-aligned UX goals.</p>
          <p>I created a unique, custom-designed **header and footer layout**
            that reflects the brand’s professionalism while enhancing usability
            and accessibility. The entire website was built using **Elementor**
            and extended with **Ultimate Add-ons** and other relevant widgets to
            ensure flexibility and responsiveness across all devices and screen
            sizes.</p>
          <p>The site structure is powered by **Custom Post Types (CPTs)** and
            **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)** to allow administrators to manage
            job listings, testimonials, and dynamic sections with ease. Each
            section was crafted with reusable and scalable logic for content
            control and layout consistency.</p>
          <p>I integrated **Contact Form 7** across various touchpoints for
            candidate and client inquiries, and configured **SMTP email delivery
            via Microsoft Outlook** to ensure secure, reliable mail delivery. In
            addition, I implemented an **Advanced Database logging system** to
            track and store every form submission directly within the WordPress

            This project was all about building a tailored digital recruitment
            experience from the ground up — one that supports both candidates
            and administrators in the fast-paced healthcare staffing industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began with a custom design approach using <strong>Elementor
              Pro</strong> and <strong>Ultimate Add-ons</strong> to create a
            clean, professional interface, with strong calls-to-action and
            mobile-friendly layouts. The goal: make job search and registration
            seamless on any device.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the backend, I developed a robust architecture using
            <strong>Custom Post Types (CPTs)</strong> and <strong>Advanced
              Custom Fields (ACF)</strong>, giving the admin team complete
            control over job listings, team bios, and informational sections —
            without any need to touch code.
          </p>
          <p>
            I integrated multiple <strong>Contact Form 7</strong> forms across
            the site, each routed securely through <strong>SMTP (Microsoft
              Outlook)</strong> to ensure enterprise-grade deliverability. To
            support internal operations, I set up a smart <strong>form
              submission logging system</strong> that captures and stores every
            entry within the WordPress dashboard — enabling quick access and
            export when needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            This site was built with speed, clarity, and conversion in mind —
            tailored for both large-screen desktops and quick mobile visits by
            frontline workers. From user flow to data structure, every detail
            was built with the audience in mind.

            IMS Nhance is a digital transformation and business services
            provider. I was brought in to design and build a custom WordPress
            website that delivers both functional flexibility and a modern
            digital experience for their clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site was developed using <strong>Elementor Pro</strong>
            alongside <strong>Ultimate Add-ons</strong> to craft intuitive,
            reusable content blocks. I structured all service offerings, case
            studies, and internal content using <strong>Custom Post Types
              (CPTs)</strong> and <strong>Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)</strong>
            — allowing the admin team to manage and scale site content easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several components such as dynamic tabs, filterable sections, and
            interactive layouts were built manually using <strong>custom HTML,
              CSS, and JavaScript</strong> to ensure maximum control and
            lightweight performance. This allowed us to break past the
            limitations of page builders and create fully tailored experiences
            across pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contact Form 7 was used to capture inquiries across the site, all
            routed via <strong>Microsoft Outlook SMTP</strong> to ensure secure,
            enterprise-level deliverability. A custom backend logic was added to
            store form data directly in the WordPress database for reporting and
            backup purposes.

            OneCall24 is one of the UK’s leading medical staffing agencies, and
            this site was built to support its high-traffic operations and
            provide clear, user-friendly access to job opportunities and
            services.

          <p>
            The site was developed using the <strong>WP Bakery Page
              Builder</strong>, allowing for rapid layout creation with custom
            styling layers and consistency across dozens of pages. I created a
            structured layout with flexible content blocks to make ongoing
            updates easy for the internal team.
          </p>
          <p>
            For lead capture, I integrated <strong>WPForms</strong> to manage
            multiple contact and registration forms, and configured them with
            custom conditional logic to ensure submissions were routed
            appropriately. To enhance credibility and user trust, I embedded a
            live feed of <strong>Google Reviews</strong> directly onto the site
            — allowing new visitors to see real client feedback in real time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also implemented several UI enhancements using <strong>custom
              HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> to refine call-to-action
            buttons, animation triggers, and sticky headers — improving the user
            experience without compromising performance.

            job categories to team overviews and dynamic call-to-actions, each
            part of the layout was designed for both clarity and engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
            For form functionality, I implemented <strong>Gravity Forms</strong>
            to handle job applications, contact forms, and candidate
            registrations. These forms included smart conditional fields,
            dynamic success messages, and spam protection. All form entries are
            logged in the admin dashboard and can be exported for reporting.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also built a completely <strong>custom frontend interface</strong>
            to match OneCall24’s educational brand identity — including advanced
            sections for candidate testimonials, location coverage maps, and key
            service highlights. Subtle animations and scroll effects were added
            to elevate user engagement and interactivity.

          <h2>Aura Staffing</h2>
          <p><strong>Website:</strong> <a

          <p>
            Aura Staffing is a healthcare recruitment platform crafted to
            connect top-tier professionals with healthcare opportunities across
            the country. The website was developed to deliver both high
            performance and flexible content management for the client’s
            evolving business needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site was built using <strong>Elementor Pro</strong>, alongside
            <strong>Premium Addons</strong> and <strong>Ultimate
              Addons</strong>, to create modular, animated layouts. The
            interface was designed to be fully responsive and visually intuitive
            across all screen sizes.
          </p>
          <p>
            For form management, I integrated both <strong>Contact Form
              7</strong> and <strong>Ninja Forms</strong> to serve different
            workflows — including inquiry handling, candidate submissions, and
            multi-step interactions. These were styled to match the brand and
            embedded across key sections to increase conversions.
          </p>
          <p>
            To bypass the limitations of the parent theme, I created several
            <strong>custom templates</strong> using a child theme approach. This
            allowed me to control layout rendering, override default behaviors,
            and build in page-specific structures that Elementor alone couldn’t
            fully handle. The result is a stable, scalable, and easily
            maintainable website that performs well across devices.
